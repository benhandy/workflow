## I use a Amazon Redshift database that leverages columnar storage, and an Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) PostgreSQL data that leverages row-oriented storage
## To assess the execution time of the analytical queries, I work with a benchmarking dataset and run 5 analytical queries to query the data from each store
